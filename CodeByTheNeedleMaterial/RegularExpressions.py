#How to use it for validation purposes
#two options
#Compiling and expression to use has validator
#string with 3 aaa and nothing else
#if not equal to none means that its a valid string

#Using the search operation tells you the position The difference between match and search is that match always starts at the beginning of the string

#All regular expressions get cached which after awhile might take a lot of memory use purge to clean it

#Look on the presentation for a lot more demos this are incredibly powerful  notorious for creating bugs when misused
